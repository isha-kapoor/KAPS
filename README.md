# KAPS
Krishi Avashesh Prabandhan Seva

## Problem Statement
The project focuses on providing a potential solution to the issue of rising air pollution because of agricultural residue in India.
The web application functions as a portal for the 3 users where in; a farmer can request for a nearby collection centre to pickup the residue, a collection centre can process that residue so that it can be stored and a private company that can buy the available waste from the residue catalogue.
KAPS performs a function of an e-commerce website where the farmer is a vendor/manufacturer and the private company is the consumer.
